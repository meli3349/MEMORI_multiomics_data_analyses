Scripts for longitudinal analyses of immune cell dynamics dervied from image mass cytometry data in the MEMORI cohort

# IMC analyses: 

1_Metacluster_plots.R \
This scripts plots cell count data for metacluster C1-28 (from phenograph analyses in OMIQ) during treatment in NRP and REP


2_CD45_metacluster_plots.R \
This scripts plots cell count data for immune metacluster (from phenograph analyses in OMIQ) during treatment in NRP and REP


3_Subsampled_immune_cell_dynamics.R \
This scripts plots cell counts and fraction of different CD4 or CD8 cell subtypes.

4_Heterogeneity_multiregion_ROIs.R \
This script plots heterogeneity of CD4 and CD8 cell counts and their activation state for samples with multiple ROIs.

5_Correlation_Tcells_immune_escape.R \
This scripts correlates CD4 and CD8 cells and their activation state (IMC data) with immune escape status and HLA LOH (WES and RNA-Seq data).
